Description: Provides functions developed at the Department of Biostatistics
    at the Epidemiology, Biostatisics and Prevention Institute, University of
    Zurich, Switzerland.  Covered topics include confidence intervals (CIs)
    for proportions, CIs for operating characteristics of
    diagnostic tests, Fagan-Nomogram, bootstrap CIs for the kappa coefficient,
    intraclass-correlation coefficients including CIs, agreement for continuous
    measurements (Bland-Altman plot), CI for the area under the curve (AUC),
    Mantel-Haenszel estimator, Mantel-Cox hazard ratio estimator, CI for the
    Kaplan-Meier estimate at given time points, CI for quantile of a
    Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimate, sample size computations for
    two-sample Mann-Whitney test, McNemar test, a binary diagnostic test,
    natural re-parametrization of Weibull
    output from survreg, hazard ratio and event time ratio interpretations, plot
    to check the adequacy of the Weibull model.
